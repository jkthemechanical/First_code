# First_code
My first program to find Day for any given date. <\n>
Interesting part was to find day on 1st January 0001, and for this I started writing the code. But eventually came to know history of calendar systems and changes happened over time and Unix epoch time.
This code will perform according to Gregorian calendar and if we consider it as standard then this program can give output for date starting from 1582.
Still I would be happy to reasearch further and to get the code corrected for historical events as per periodical standard calendars and to find the Day on 01/01/0001.
Thank you :)
